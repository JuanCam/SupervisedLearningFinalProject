# Alzheimer's Prevention - Supervised Learning Final Project
## CSCA 5622 Supervised Learning Final Project

Welcome to the Alzheimer's Prevention Project, where we will be predicting if someone has Alzheimer's depending on some data.

The entire project is a single Jupyter Notebook which is present on this repository. To be able to run it yourself you must these are the prerequisites:

- Python 3
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)

I recommend to run the notebook in Visual Code. You can also just visualize the PDF exported version in this repository.
